echoThat lets you share content from anywhere online without the distraction of a noisy social media interface.

echoThat is an extension for Google Chrome that allows users to share across social media networks with a keystroke and a click. Highlight content and press ctrl + e to call up the echoThat widget.

On the widget, you can edit the quoted text and add your own commentary before echoing it out to social media.

All echos will have a shortened link to the page you sent them from. The echoThat character counter takes the link into account.

echoThat requires for the user to be signed into their chrome browser to work correctly.

We currently support echos through Twitter and Facebook. These networks can be quickly set up with one-time authorization through the echoThat popup menu, called by clicking our icon at the top of your browser.

In the popup menu, you can also quickly enable or disable posting to your social networks one by one, by toggling on/off switches.

We built echoThat to make sharing quick and customizable. Enjoy!
