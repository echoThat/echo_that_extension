NOTE: Please feel free to use the account "Echo ThatApp" to test this. That will allow us to demonstrate what the functionality will be like once we are authorized for publish_actions.

1: Use google Chrome, an be sure you are logged in to the browser using your google account.

2: Install our extension by clicking "Add to Chrome" at this link (you'll have to accept the chrome permissions we ask for): https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/echothat/clbbcmmpgpilnnaengcjkchkgheflgpg/related

3: Restart the chrome browser.

4: Click the Echo That icon in your Chrome browser, right of the url bar, to show the configuration popup.  Select "connect to Facebook." You will be redirected to facebook.

5: If you are not logged in to facebook, you will need to do so.
*Note: As an Echo That user, you will NOT be logging into Echo That via facebook. This is an outside redirect for a one-time grant of permission for us to post on your behalf when you use our echo function.

6: Accept the "publish_actions" permission. You will be redirected to an instructional Echo That page.

7: To post to facebook via echoThat, open a new tab and find some text you'd like to post--at your favorite news site, for example.

8: From any web page, highlight text and press ctrl+e to call up the echoThat widget. Click the echoThat button--on the right side of the widget--to post the quote you highlighted, with a link and any comments you'd like to add on the bottom line, to facebook.
