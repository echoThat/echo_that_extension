# onPoint
A seamless sharing tool for Google Chrome. Just drag to highlight and click to post.

Users preconfigure their settings. Does every selection they post have a shortened link attached? Do they post to twitter AND facebook, or just one?

Users can also tweak settings and add text for each post via the onPoint tooltip.
