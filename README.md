Edit the quoted text and add your own commentary if you'd like. Then click the echoThat button to send your echo out to social media outlets that you configure with a quick authorization from the extension popup menu.

This tool allows you to share the content you come across during your internet travels, without having to stop what you're doing to visit a social media site.

We created it to allow people to post to social media without being distracted by a visit to twitter, facebook, or other applications that force you to view the posts of others when you only want to send something out.

echoThat is a quiet, simple way to share from anywhere on the internet.
